#Drive Press Plugin Core#

This WordPress plugin was the start of a web offering that would allow the export and syncing of WordPress pages and posts with a google drive. The plugin as provides ui for post/page edit screens as well as some basic settings. As it is now it just sends a page id and source url via a post request to a test page. This plugin is not what I call functional it is the start of a bigger project that never got off the ground


##Files
This plugin code is split into different extended classes, all the core function code can be found in the php files in the parent directory of the repo while the ui html views can be found in the [ui subdirectory](/ui) and custom css is in the [css subdirectory](/css)
